# Basics of Git

## What is Git?

Git is a version control software that lets you more effectively track your digital work over time, in a way that makes it very easy to collaborate with others.

## Why are we using Git?

### Transferability

It makes our projects more transferable, for one. Inevitably, these projects (usually) span more than one person (IE Person A works on a dataset, graduates, and then Person B does analysis on said dataset).

### Collaboration

Using git, through some smart design decisions on the authors' part, lets us automatically merge changes that two different people might make on the same file, without overwriting each other.

### Transparency

Using git allows us to upload all of our digital work to GitHub, which lets it all be viewable on the Travelers Lab GitHub page, and lets us explain ourselves in the form of MarkDown Files [Going to be the topic of its own tutorial later]

## So, how do I learn Git?

(Ignore the part about publishing online and syncing
 with online for now -- it will make sense later)

^^ This is a good general explanation of git and GitHub;

ignore the developer speak (it's not particularly important, what is important is seeing you can upload files and see changes over time)

## What do I do to get it working on my computer?

### Install Git

Firstly, you want to install Git, by downloading the correct version for your computer's operating system (Windows, macOS, etc.)
https://git-scm.com/downloads

This is the software itself, but it normally works through a unintuitive command line interface. Which leads us to the next part to install...

## Install GitHub Desktop

Secondly, you want to install GitHub Desktop, which provides you a nice 'point-and-click' interface to use git on your local computer, as well as a good way to sync up what you do to GitHub.

The GitHub tutorial will go into this in more detail.
