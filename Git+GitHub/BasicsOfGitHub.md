# Basics of GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service; in essence, what that
means is that we can host our work on here, in a way that's visible to the world,
and in a way that collaboration amongst ourselves, and with others, is quite easy.

[This site](https://www.howtogeek.com/180167/htg-explains-what-is-github-and-what-do-geeks-use-it-for/) explains GitHub in more detail.

## How do I make an account?

Head over to [github.com](https://www.github.com) and create one!

## Where is the Travelers Lab on GitHub?

[Here!](https://github.com/TravelersLab)

You'll see that it's just a list of projects (referred to -- in GitHub lingo -- as 'repositories').

Each of us can contribute to these projects, in addition to create new ones.
All of our work (if we want it to be) is visible for other people to see and contribute to.

## How do I contribute to the Travelers Lab page?

Well, first you need permissions, so talk to one of the people who have admin
access.
